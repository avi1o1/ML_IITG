# ML_IITG

In the summer break of 2023-24, I enrolled in [Summer Analytics](https://www.caciitg.com/sa/), a primer course on Data Science and Machine Learning. The course was conducted by the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati in partnership with various industry leaders like Geeks for Geeks, Coding Ninjas, AI Planet, Pathway and Zoho.

This online data science certification course revolved around the concepts of Python, Machine Learning, Data Cleaning and Data Analysis. It aimed at helping students understand core concepts and the latest advancements including aspects of Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning, and introduce the very latest tools and algorithms used in the industry.

This repository contains all of weekly assignments, quizzes, and tasks completed during the 6-week summer course on Machine Learning, conducted by IIT Guwahati.

Note that this is not an exhaustive resource list. Even in this course we followed various other standalone videos, medium articles, kaggle blogs and websites. Additionally, we attended various talks, webinars, hands-on activities and hackathons, which together with the final project helped us get a good understanding in the topic (which still might not be sufficient).

On a side note, I have [another repository](https://github.com/avi1o1/PyLibs) dedicated to various python libraries that might come handy in your ML journey.
