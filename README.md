# ML_IITG

This repository contains weekly assignments, quizzes, and tasks completed during a 6-week summer course on Machine Learning, conducted by IIT Guwahati.

## Contents

1. **Week 1**: Python and Statistics
   - Introduction to Python : The most widely used language in the domain of Machine Learning
   - Python Libraries like Numpy, MatplotLib and Pandas : In-depth understanding and usage in ML fields
   - Basics of Statistics : Variable Types, Distributions and Quantiles

2. **Week 2**: Introduction to Machine Learning
   - Introduction to Machine Learning : Types, Uses, Importance and Vision
   - Linear Regression : Along with multi-regression
   - Logistic Regression : As a tool for classification problems

3. **Week 3**: Performance Evaluation
   - Regularisation : Feature Engineering and Concepts in Data PreProcessing
   - Model Performance : Bias, Variance, Confusion Matrix, AOC, ROC and Bag of Words
   - Support Vector Machines : Tool used in both Regression and Classification Problems

4. **Week 4**: Trees and Boosting
   - Trees : Decision Trees, Random Forests and K-Nearest Neighbours
   - Boosting : XGBoost, CatBoost and AdaBoost
   - Performance Enhancement : Cross Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning and Grid/Random Search

5. **Week 5**: 

## Installations Required
xgboost, keras, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Note that this is not an exhaustive resource list. Even in this course we followed various other standalone videos, medium articles, kaggle blogs and websites. Additionally, we attended various talks, webinars, hands-on activities and hackathons, which together with the final project helped us get a good understanding in the topic (which still might not be sufficient).

On a side note, I have [another repository](https://github.com/avi1o1/PyLibs) dedicated to various pyhon libraries that might come handy in your ML journey.
